# AllRgb-Go

Builds an image (modular in size) using the 24bit color set (16.7 million colors). Depending on the algorithm you choose, the picture created will have a different design. Most of the algorithms are fully unique, meaning each and every color in the 16.7 million color set is used only once to create the stunning image.
